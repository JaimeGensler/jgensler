## Introduction

Hey! Thanks for checking out my website. Please, take the time to read up about
me, check out my projects, or, if you're visiting from the future, check out
some of my other posts! Moving forward, I plan to make my blog primarily about
my progress as a software engineer - I (think I) am a multi-interested person,
so topics from post to post may vary pretty significantly. However, my posts
will generally be about different projects I'm working on, technologies I'm
currently learning, or even just code/tech-related things I feel like writing
about. Posts should come out every 2-4 weeks, so check back often!

The body of this post should be detailing how I created this blog. As I've
mostly been pushing to finish this project, this particular post may be a little
bit shorter than subsequent posts should be. Also, I don't think this topic
(creating a blog with React, Next, and MDX) is particularly interesting,
considering basically everybody ever has talked about this.

As a final note, I'm still putting some final touches on the blog to improve
general site accessibility and ease-of-use from mobile. Please
[email me](mailto:jaimegensler0@gmail.com) about accessibility issues,
mobile-use issues, ~~job offers~~, broken links, or your opinion on how the site
looks / how it could be improved. Genuinely, I love constructive criticism.

With all that aside, let's dive in!

## Making of the blog

### The Stack

When I decided to start the project, I knew I wanted to make the site with
**Next.js** and **React** - Next.js for its easy file-based routing and general
developer ergonomics, and React because yes. I was originally leaning towards
using Ant Design and Styled Components to get the styling done, but at the
recommendation of one of my brothers, I decided to check out **Tailwind CSS**.
And holy guacermole, does Tailwind feel gooooood to write. Tailwind also
provided a better opportunity to practice my raw(ish) CSS chops than a component
library like AntD would have done, so that's another point for Tailwind.

I decided early on that, since I'm a developer and comfortable writing my posts
in a code editor and keeping them as part of project files, I don't need a page
on the site to write my posts. I also didn't feel a real need to allow comment
submission on the site or to have any display on the post (I'd rather just take
emails), so I effectively had no need for a database.

My first instinct was to just write my posts as JSON. Any given post might look
something like this:

```js
const post = [
    {
        type: 'metadata',
        data: {
            title: 'Welcome to my blog!'
            slug: 'welcome-to-my-blog',
        }
    },
    {
        type: 'paragraph',
        data: 'This is a paragraph. There are many things that could be written here.'
    },
    ...
];
```

Then I'd make a `pages/blog/\[slug\].tsx` file, import all the posts, select the
post array depending on the current route, and map over it and turn it into JSX.
This would have worked, but it also would have turned out to be incredibly
tedious. While speaking to my brother again he recommended I use **MDX**. With
MDX, you can write the post in Markdown (and also import React components into
the `.mdx` file if necessary), and with some magic and the help of a few other
packages, have the markdown turned into React components. Same setup and control
over the display that React gives, significantly more pleasant to actually
write. With those
