## Introduction

Hey! Thanks for checking out my website. Please, take the time to read up about
me, check out my projects, or, if you're visiting from the future, check out
some of my other posts! Moving forward, I plan to make my blog primarily about
my progress as a software engineer - I (think I) am a multi-interested person,
so topics from post to post may vary pretty significantly. However, my posts
will generally be about different projects I'm working on, technologies I'm
currently learning, or even just code/tech-related things I feel like writing
about. Posts should come out every 2-4 weeks, so check back often!

The body of this post should be detailing how I created this blog. As I've
mostly been pushing to finish this project, this particular post may be a little
bit shorter than subsequent posts should be. Also, I don't think this topic
(creating a blog with React, Next, and MDX) is particularly interesting,
considering basically everybody ever has talked about this.

As a final note, I'm still putting some final touches on the blog to improve
general site accessibility and ease-of-use from mobile. Please
[email me](mailto:jaimegensler0@gmail.com) about accessibility issues,
mobile-use issues, ~~job offers~~, broken links, or your opinion on how the site
looks / how it could be improved. Genuinely, I love constructive criticism.

With all that aside, let's dive in!

## Making of the blog

### The Stack

When I decided to start the project, I knew I wanted to make the site with
**Next.js** and **React** - Next.js for its easy file-based routing and general
developer ergonomics, and React because yes. I was originally leaning towards
using Ant Design and Styled Components to get the styling done, but at the
recommendation of one of my brothers, I decided to check out **Tailwind CSS**.
And holy guacermole, does Tailwind feel gooooood to write. Tailwind also
provided a better opportunity to practice my raw(ish) CSS chops than a component
library like AntD would have done, so that's another point for Tailwind.
