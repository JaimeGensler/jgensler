Did you ever hear the story of
[Plato's Republic](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_(Plato)>)? I thought
not. It's not a story your high school would tell you. It's a philosophical
text. Socrates was a philosopher, so powerful and so wise he could use logic to
influence discussion and perfect theoretical life. He had such a knowledge of
the world that he could even convince the ones he cared about from being slaves
to the Cave. The dark of the Cave is a pathway to many misconceptions
philosophers consider to be all to natural. He became so powerful, the only
thing he was afraid of was synthesizing his argument, which eventually, of
course, he did. Fortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then
his apprentice wrote his argument in The Republic. Ironic... He could write
other philosophers' arguments on justice, but not his own.
